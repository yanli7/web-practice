        <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Python is Interpreted</b> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
            <li><b>Python is Interactive</b> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
            <li><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
            <li><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="history">
        <header>History</header>
        <p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>
        <p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
        <p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="features">
        <header>Feature</header>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
            <li>A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
            <li>Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
            <li>Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
            <li>Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
            <li>Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
            <li>GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
            <li>Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
        </ul>

        <header>Syntax</header>
        <code>$ python<br>
            Python 2.4.3 (#1, Nov 11 2010, 13:34:43)<br>
            [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on linux2<br>
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.<br>
            >>></code>
        <p>Type the following text at the Python prompt and press the Enter −</p>
        <code>>>> print "Hello, Python!"</code>
        <p>If you are running new version of Python, then you would need to use print statement with parenthesis as in <b>print ("Hello, Python!");</b>. However in Python version 2.4.3, this produces the following result −</p>
        <code>Hello, Python!</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>
        <p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example −</p>
        <code>#!/usr/bin/python<br><br>

            counter = 100          # An integer assignment<br>
            miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point<br>
            name    = "John"       # A string<br><br>

            print counter<br>
            print miles<br>
            print name</code>
        <p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the following result −</p>
        <code>100
            1000.0
            John</code>
        <p>Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously. For example −</p>
        <code>a = b = c = 1</code>
        <p>Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all three variables are assigned to the same memory location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables. For example −</p>
        <code>a,b,c = 1,2,"john"</code>
        <p>Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to variables a and b respectively, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable c.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
        <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths. A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.</p>
        <p>Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>while loop</strong></dt>
            <dd>- Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</dd>
            <dt><strong>for loop</strong></dt>
            <dd>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</dd>
            <dt><strong>nested loops</strong></dt>
            <dd>You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Loop Control Statements</h3>
        <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
        <p>Python supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>break statement</b></dt>
            <dd>- Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</dd>
            <dt><b>continue statement</b></dt>
            <dd>- Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</dd>
            <dt><b>pass statement</b></dt>
            <dd>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</dd>
        </dl>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
        <p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.</p>
        <h3>Defining a Function</h3>
        <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword <b>def</b> followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</li>
            <li>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</li>
            <li>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or <i>docstring</i>.</li>
            <li>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</li>
            <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <code>def functionname( parameters ):<br>
            "function_docstring"<br>
            function_suite<br>
            return [expression]</code>
        <p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.</p>
        <code>def printme( str ):<br>
            "This prints a passed string into this function"<br>
            print str<br>
            return</code>
        <h3>Calling a Function</h3>
        <p>Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is the example to call printme() function −</p>
        <code>#!/usr/bin/python<br><br>

            # Function definition is here<br>
            def printme( str ):<br>
            "This prints a passed string into this function"<br>
            print str<br>
            return;<br><br>

            # Now you can call printme function<br>
            printme("I'm first call to user defined function!")<br>
            printme("Again second call to the same function")</code>
        <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −</p>
        <code>I'm first call to user defined function!<br>
            Again second call to the same function</code>
